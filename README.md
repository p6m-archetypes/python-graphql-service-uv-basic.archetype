## 🎯 Use Cases

This archetype is ideal for:

1. **Domain Services**: GraphQL services focused on specific business domains
   - Products service, Users service, Orders service
   - Can be federated into a larger GraphQL gateway (schema stitching)
   - Provides flexible querying within a single domain
   - Alternative to REST for client-driven data fetching

2. **Data Aggregation Services**: Services combining data from multiple sources
   - Fetch from databases, REST APIs, gRPC services, message queues
   - DataLoader pattern for efficient batching and caching
   - Resolve complex data graphs across multiple backends
   - Transform and optimize data for client consumption

3. **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)**: Tailored APIs for specific client types
   - Web BFF, Mobile BFF, Desktop BFF with optimized schemas
   - Client-specific field selection and pagination strategies
   - Reduce over-fetching by letting clients query exactly what they need
   - Version-free APIs through schema evolution

4. **Python-First Architectures**: When Python's ecosystem is the primary choice
   - Strawberry GraphQL with FastAPI for high performance
   - Integration with Python data science and ML libraries
   - Modern Python 3.11+ async/await support

**Architectural Note**: GraphQL services can be:
- **Standalone**: Complete domain service with its own database
- **Federated**: Part of a larger GraphQL gateway (schema federation)
- **Aggregator**: Combines REST/gRPC services into a unified GraphQL API
- **Hybrid**: Mix of direct data access and service delegation

   # Start with monitoring
   # Uncomment monitoring extensions in server/graphql/schema.py

   # Add security features
   # Uncomment security extensions

   # Enable subscriptions last
   # Uncomment WebSocket routes and event bus
   ```

3. **Test each feature**:

   ```bash
   # Run tests to ensure compatibility
   uv run pytest -m graphql
   ./validate_archetype.sh
